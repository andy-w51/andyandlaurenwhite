                        Lauren and Andy took a break from wedding planning and
                        went to Italy for their 2016 Easter holiday.

                        They enjoyed a lovely few days in Pisa and Florence that

                        combined their love of food (Andy) and wine (Lauren)...
                        just ask Andy about his 1kg/35oz of steak!

                        The souvenir from this trip, besides a few bottles of
                        wine (which have already been consumed), was a wild boar,
                        native to the region. However, then Andy ate one in a 
                        ragu dish, and enjoyed it (what a weirdo).
