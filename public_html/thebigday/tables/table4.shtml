                    <p>
                        Andy and Lauren journeyed to Portland, Oregon during
                        their US trip in June 2015, to attend Lauren's cousin's
                        wedding. 
                    </p>
                    <img class="bottomRight" src="thebigday/tables/images/portlandandy.jpg" width="216" height="288" alt="Portland, OR" />
                    <p>
                        Andy did not realise quite how long it would take to
                        drive through this state, as he claims everything in the
                        US is actually much further away than it seems on a map.
                        However, in a city known for craft beer and good food,
                        Andy was in heaven.

                        The souvenir from this trip was a beaver, which is the
                        mascot of the Oregon State University football team,
                        which Lauren's cousin used to play for.
