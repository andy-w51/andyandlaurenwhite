                    <p>
                        Lauren and Andy adventured in Greece for their 2015
                        Easter holiday.

                        The weather wasn't all that warm, but the scenery was
                        beautiful. The food was great, even when Andy managed to
                        order two plates of meatballs instead of two Mythos
                        (beers).

                        The trip was a good balance of history and city life in
                        Athens followed by a relaxing trip to the tiny island 
                        of Hydra...where there are no cars, but a LOT of cats.
