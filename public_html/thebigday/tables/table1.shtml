                    <p>
                        After months of Andy telling Lauren all about how much she
                        would love Cornwall, they finally took a week off and road
                        tripped to the seaside in September 2015.

                    <p>
                        Andy drove Lauren all over the place on the small Cornish
                        roads, and showed her some of the most beautiful places from
                        his childhood like Padstow, Constantine Bay, St. Michael's
                        Mount, and St. Ives.

                        "Paddy Lobstow", as he's lovingly called, is their souvenir
                        from this great trip.
