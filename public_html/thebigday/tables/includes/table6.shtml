<h2>Greece - Cat</h2>
<p>
    Lauren and Andy adventured in Greece for their 2015 Easter holiday. 
</p>
<p>
    The weather wasn't all that warm, but the scenery was beautiful. The food
    was great, even when Andy managed to order two plates of meatballs instead
    of two Mythos (beers).

<p>
    The trip was a good balance of history and city life in Athens followed by
    a relaxing trip to the tiny island of Hydra...where there are no cars, but a
    LOT of cats.  Brita and Rachel â€“ this one's for you!
